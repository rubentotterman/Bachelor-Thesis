Bachelor Thesis – TikTok Insight Web Application

This is the final project for my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at Kristiania University College, developed in collaboration with **Hepta AS**.

The goal was to build a modern, responsive, and user-friendly web application that integrates with the TikTok API (mocked), providing businesses with insight data through an interactive dashboard. It supports features like login/auth, invoicing, and data visualization — all wrapped in clean UI/UX design.
